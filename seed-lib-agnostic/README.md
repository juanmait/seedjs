# Seed Lib Agnostic

This setup is for development of libraries that should be able to run on both,
nodejs and the browser, but without using native APIs.

## Use Cases

This are the _ideal_ use cases. As such, not always will be posible to stay
_aligned_. Some of the restrictions can be easily disabled via configuring
eslint, tsconfig and/or installing the desired @types.

1. _**Agnostic libraries**_ that _should_ NOT call native APIs at all, neither
   from Nodejs or the browser.
2. Libraries that can eventually READ from native APIs only to know more about
   the kind of environment in which they are running. E.g.:
   ```js
   if (window && window.localStorage) {
     // now we know that we're running on the browser..
     // do something without calling any native APIs
   }
   ```
3. Libraries that based on the info from point **2**, decides to use a nodejs
   targeted lib or a browser targeted lib to do the same job.
4. Another way to use an agnostic library would be use it like an interface.

**Note 1**: Keep in mind that ideally a _library_ is just a set of tools,
utilities or helpers that does nothing by themselves but instead are intended to
be used as a part of other libraries, apps, or programs.

**Note 2**: The output when you build for _production_ will still use CommonJS
modules (e.g: `const { hello } = require('./world')`).

## Env interpolation

This setup uses two babel plugins to convert envs (like `process.env.MY_ENV`)
to plain strings at build time. The plugins are:

- [babel-plugin-transform-node-env-inline]
- [babel-plugin-transform-inline-environment-variables]

So for example, having **MY_ENV=somestring**:

```js
const myEnv = process.env.MY_ENV

// will be transformed to..

const myEnv = 'somestring'

// it also transform statements like this:

const isProd = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'

// into this...

const isProd = true
```

Envs can be given via command line when launching babel to build the source
code:

    NODE_ENV=development babel src --out-dir build ...

## Available Scripts

```bash
$ yarn start
# Start the development mode. It builds the source code and keep watching for
# changes. It also launch a watcher to build the typescript declaration files.

$ yarn build
# build for prod (will run `prebuild` automatically). This does not minify the
# output, does not make dead code elimination and does not bundle your files in
# one single chunk of code. If the thing you're building that use this library
# runs on nodejs, minification or bundling have no sense. In the other hand if
# the thing you're building that is using this library will run in the browser,
# then minification and bundling is the responsibility of the bundling tool that
# you may use when releasing to production (e.g: webpack, parcel, rollup,
# create-react-app).

$ yarn prebuild
# run `clean`, `fix`, `lint` & `checkTypes`

$ yarn test
# run all the test files using JEST

$ yarn checkTypes
# check for typescript errors

$ yarn lint
# check for lint errors using tslint for `.ts` files and eslint for `.js`.

$ yarn fix
# auto format and auto fix all the source code using `prettier-tslint` and
# `prettier-eslint`

$ yarn checkConflicts
# detect configurations conflicts between eslint/tslint and prettier

$ yarn clean
# remove the build folder
```

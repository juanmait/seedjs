# SeedJS - electron-react-basic

This branch showcases a setup to work with [react] in [electron] without using
[create-react-app] or [webpack]. In this environment we don't actually need to
bundle our source code. We can _import_ our modules just like we do in nodejs.

This setup uses only [babel] to support typescript, ES2018, JSX and some more
sugar..
